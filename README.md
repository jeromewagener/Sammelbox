Sammelbox
=================

Sammelbox is the name of a collection manager suite (desktop & mobile version)
The project itself was originally started by Jérôme Wagener and Paul Bicheler and is licensed under the GPLv3. No prior revision history before the 20th April 2013 is available since the project was imported from a private SVN repository. 

## Features

- Manage any kind of collection with no limits to your imagination. The "Album" in 
  which your collection items are stored is fully customizable and can be adapted at
  any time. The user interface will adapt itself automatically to the "Album" that you just created!
- Search & filter using the power of native SQL queries
- Synchronize your collection with a mobile device over your local LAN or WLAN. While synchronizing,
  no data will be sent through the internet, making your collection invisible to other people.
- Import & Export features (CSV, HTML) as well as a standardized SQLite database in which all data is stored.
  This means that your data is always available on a local database that you have total control over.

## Technical Information

- Java / HTML / JavaScript / CSS based
- Uses a SQLite database which can be inspected and modified through any standard SQLite viewer 
- Native user interface support through SWT for Windows, Linux and Mac OS

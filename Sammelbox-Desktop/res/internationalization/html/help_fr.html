			<h4 id="Q1">What is Sammelbox?<a href="#top"><h6 style="display:inline"> [Go to top]</h6></a></h4>
				<p>Sammelbox is a free and open-source collection manager. By design, Sammelbox allows to define 
					fully customizable collections <i>(called "Albums")</i> using a variety of different field types.
					In fact, Sammelbox supports amongst others the following field types: text, ratings, integers, 
					decimals, urls, pictures and more...</p>
				<p>In addition, Sammelbox provides import and export capabilities and even provides the possibility 
					to synchronize with mobile devices using the Sammelbox-Android app. Different album views as well as 
					advanced search features finally allow to easily manage your collectables!</p>
				<p>Please check www.Sammelbox.org for further information!</p>

			<h4 id="Q1">Some feature that I need is missing! What can I do?<a href="#top"><h6 style="display:inline"> [Go to top]</h6></a></h4>
				<p>Sammelbox was designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. Thus, only the most used features are immediately visible.
				However, some features are hidden and only available by pop-up menues. Right-clicking on the album list for reveals for example
				the possibility to sort the collection. Nevertheless, some features might be missing. In this case, please visit www.sammelbox.org
				or write an email to contact@sammelbox.org and let us know.</p>				

			<h4 id="Q3">How can I easily add multiple items?<a href="#top"><h6 style="display:inline"> [Go to top]</h6></a></h4>
				<p>The easiest way to add multiple items at once is to use the spreadsheet view. The spreadsheet view
					gives you the possibility to add multiple items at once using a grid similar to Microsoft Excel
					or Open Office Calc. Please note: it is not possible to add pictures while adding items using the
					spreadsheet view. However, they can be easily added later.</p>

			<h4 id="Q4">What is a saved search?<a href="#top"><h6 style="display:inline"> [Go to top]</h6></a></h4>
				<p>Sammelbox allows you to perform advanced searches on your collection. To avoid redefining
					these searches each single time, they can be saved by giving them a unique name. Saved searches can
					also be easily edited. Please note: in case you modify the album structure (e.g. by deleting a field)
					your saved search might no longer work. In this case it will be necessary to adapt your saved 
					search accordingly</p>

			<h4 id="Q5">How can I sort my albums?<a href="#top"><h6 style="display:inline"> [Go to top]</h6></a></h4>
				<p>By default, your albums (collections) will be sorted by the first album field. However, you have
					the possibility to sort the album by any album field using the album list pop up menu.
					<i>(just right click on the album table and a menu will open)</i> Sammelbox also provides the possibility
					to not apply a particular sorting. In this case, the album items will appear in the order that they
					were added to the album.</p>
